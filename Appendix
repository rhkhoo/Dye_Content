# Sample Calculations

1. Sample calculation for normalizing absorbance values
A solution of about 4 X 10<sup>-7</sup> M Red 40 has an absorbance of 0.016333 at 429 nm, 0.056115 at 505 nm, and 0.00259 at 630 nm. Because 505 nm is the λmax of Red 40, all absorbance values were divided by the absorbance of Red 40:
Giving: <br>

| 429 nm	| 505 nm | 630 nm |
|  0.291  |	 1.00  | 0.0462 |

2.  For Kool-Aid Bursts Cherry, the concentration can be found using the Beer-Lambert Law:

0.3198=(2.50 ×10<sup>4</sup>  L/(mol∙cm))∙(1.00 cm)∙c

Solving for c, the concentration of Red 40 in Cherry Kool-Aid Bursts is 1.28 X 10<sup>-5</sup> M Red 40; however, this is the concentration after the 25-fold dilution. The actual concentration of Red 40 in Kool-Aid Bursts Cherry is 3.19553 X 10<sup>-4</sup> M Red 40. To find the mass of Red 40 in one hundred milliliters of Kool-Aid Bursts Cherry,
100 mL∙(3.20×10^<sup>-4</sup>  mol/(1000 mL))∙((496.42 g )/mol)∙((1000 mg)/(1 g))

The mass of Red 40 in 100 mL of Kool-Aid Bursts Cherry is 16 mg.
