# Introduction

 The use of additives to alter food’s appearance goes back to the first century C.E. when wine merchants used smoke and aloe extract to improve the color of the wine, possibly to fool customers into believing the wine was better quality than it really was. This practice of using additives to deceive consumers continued for hundreds of years with milk tinted yellow to hide that it was watered-down and bread dyed white to hide the use of low quality flour.<sup>1</sup> Many of these colorants were quite toxic, with lead chromate and lead oxide being used for the tasks mentioned above, respectively.<sup>1</sup> Even tea was cut with iron filings, clay, and copper sulfate that would make the color more intense to hide the fact that the actual amount of tea being purchased was much less than advertised.<sup>2</sup> However, consumers were not completely blind to this practice. <br><br>
 As far back as 1292, “pure food laws” existed to hold manufacturers and sellers accountable if their products were found to be adulterated.<sup>2</sup> In 1856, the first synthetic organic dye was accidentally created by William Perkin – a discovery that led to the creation of many more of these “coal-tar” dyes (so called because of the material from which they were originally extracted) whose use became widespread in the food industry.<sup>1</sup> These organic dyes were less dangerous alternatives to the heavy metal inorganic compounds used previously, but their safety is still not certain. In 1906, the Pure Food and Drug Act was passed in the United States, finally regulating which of these coal-tar dyes were considered safe for use in food and drugs.<sup>1</sup> It is clear that for most of history, humans have had a desire to know what is in their food. <br><br>
 Perhaps now is the time, in our health-centric society, when what is in our food is most important to us. We are no longer hunter-gatherers, taking whatever we can find. We are faced with seemingly endless choices of what to eat, and with all these choices we want to be certain we are making the right ones. <br><br>
Making the right decisions about food is especially important when it comes to our children. One topic that has recently gotten much attention is artificial food dyes.<sup>3</sup> These dyes are used to add color to an otherwise colorless product, to restore the color of a product whose natural color was lost through processing, or to standardize the appearance of products when the natural color may vary.<sup>4</sup> Artificial dyes are used because they are cheaper and more stable than their naturally derived counterparts. There are currently seven major Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FD&C) dyes approved for use in the United States, with the four most common being Red 40 (“Allura Red”), Blue 1 (“Brilliant Blue”), Yellow 5 (“Tartrazine”), and Yellow 6 (“Sunset Yellow”). <br><br>
 Countries around the world are concerned with the safety of these dyes. Red 40 is banned in Denmark, Belgium, France, Switzerland, and Sweden. Yellow 5 is banned in Norway.<sup>5</sup> The European Union requires any product containing Yellow 5 to carry a label warning consumers about possible allergic reactions.<sup>5</sup> <br><br>
 A study has shown that some food additives may have adverse effects on children’s behavioral development with certain artificial food dyes linked to hyperactivity and attention deficit.<sup>6</sup> Red 40 has the potential to cause allergic reactions in those who are genetically predisposed. Yellow 5 has been implicated in attention deficit problems in children and allergic reactions among asthmatics and those with an aspirin intolerance.<sup>5</sup> Blue 1 has been linked to allergic reactions in those with pre-existing asthma.<sup>5</sup> Symptoms of allergic reactions from all three of these dyes include skin rashes, stomach cramps, and difficulty breathing. <br><br>
 Knowing this, parents may want their children to avoid consuming anything containing artificial food dyes, but this may prove difficult as the majority of food and beverages marketed to children contain at least one artificial dye.<sup>7</sup> These allergic reactions are happening with higher frequency, perhaps because our exposure to these dyes has increased as more and more manufacturers include them among their ingredients. In fact, in the United States, artificial food dye consumption has increased five-fold since 1950.<sup>7</sup> <br><br>
 These claims of allergic reactions and hyperactivity have been investigated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA); however, the evidence has not been strong enough to merit any change in the “generally recognized as safe” status of any of these dyes as an approved artificial food dye. The FDA claims that any increase in hyperactivity can be attributed to “a unique intolerance to these substances and not to any inherent neurotoxic properties.”8 It should also be noted that these reactions with Yellow 5 are only seen in 0.12% of the general population.<sup>5</sup> <br><br>
 Currently, food manufacturers are required to list any artificial dyes their product contains, but they are not required to list the quantity. This quantity could be the deciding factor when purchasing one product over another. The FDA recommends that people consume no more than 7 milligrams of Red 40, 6 milligrams of Blue 1, and 7.5 milligrams of Yellow 5 per kilogram of body weight per day.<sup>9</sup> Therefore, if the product has a high amount of any of these dyes per serving, the consumer may be less likely to buy it. However, since manufacturers do not have to report the *amount* of dye present, the consumer has no way of knowing if the product is safe. <br><br>
 Less than one milligram of these dyes can produce an intense color, so if the dye is used to color food, a very small amount should suffice. The amount of food dyes in most products is probably not high enough to cause any adverse health effect in adults, but the dose needed to cause adverse health effects in children may be much smaller.<sup>9</sup> Because of this possibility, this study is focused on determining the quantities of Red 40, Blue 1, and Yellow 5 in products commonly consumed by children using UV-Visible absorbance spectroscopy. Yellow 6 was not studied because spectral overlap between Yellow 5 and Yellow 6 is so great that it is not reliably possible to tell the two dyes apart using this experimental technique. <br><br>
 Beverages and liquid medicines contain the highest concentration of artificial food colorants (AFCs) and were therefore the most appealing samples for analysis considering the experimental approach. Solids containing AFCs were not used as samples because getting the dye into an aqueous state did not yield transparent enough solutions for UV-Visible analysis.<br><br>
 
# Key Terms

1. **Beer's Law** - named for German mathetician August Beer, this law states that the amount of light a dissolved substance absorbs is directly proportional to that substance's concentration in solution, represented by the equation:<br><br>

 A = epsilon * concentration * pathlength
<br><br>
 Where A is the absorbance, epsilon is the molar absorptivity, and pathlength is the length through which light is passed. In this experiment the pathlength is always 1.<br><br>
2. **Absorbance** - a unitless measurement of the amount of light absorbed by a dissolved substance in solution <br><br> 
3. **Molar absorptivity** - represented by epsilon, a measure of how much light one mole of substance absorbs, units are L M<sup>-1</sup> cm<sup>-1</sup> <br><br>
4. **Molarity** - abbreviated "M", a unit of measurement for concentration of a solution, one mole of substance per one liter of solution <br><br>
5. **Mole** - abbreviated "mol", one mole is 6.022 X 10<sup>23</sup> molecules of a substance <br><br>
6. **λmax** - the wavelength of light at which a substance absorbs the maximum amount of light <br><br>
7. **Molar mass** - the mass of substance in one mole, usually measured in grams per mole<br><br>

# Experimental Design

Calibration curves for Red 40, Blue 1, and Yellow 5 were constructed by creating a stock of each dye and diluting each stock according to the dilution schemes shown in Tables 3-5. Each standard was analyzed using a Cary Scan 50 UV-Visible spectrophotometer. The absorbance of each standard at the dye’s wavelength of maximum absorbance (λmax) was measured using deionized water as a blank. The data were compiled into a calibration curve for each dye using sklearn's LinearRegression. The slopes of these calibration curves were used as the molar absorptivities for analysis since the pathlength of the cell was 1.00 cm and the concentration was in molarity as per the Beer-Lambert Law. <br><br>
 The dyes were separated from the samples by pulling the samples through a Supelclean LC-18 SepPak. The SepPak was cleaned with HPLC-grade methanol and then conditioned with a 1% acetic acid solution. One drop of this acetic acid solution was added to 3 mL of each sample to ensure the dyes would adsorb to the packing. The solution that came off the packing was analyzed using the UV-Visible spectrophotometer to see if anything else in the solution absorbed at the dye in question’s λmax. If the sample contained no component other than the dye that absorbed at the λmax, the sample was analyzed using the UV-vis without any preparation. If a sample contained compounds other than the three dyes in question that absorb at the λmax of any of the dyes, the absorbance of the other compound was subtracted from the absorbance of the sample before any calculations were done. <br><br>
The Kool-Aid Bursts (Cherry, Grape, and Fruit Punch), Gatorade Fruit Punch, Gatorade Tropical Cooler, Hawaiian Punch, the Powerades (Blackberry, Mountain Berry, Lemon Lime, and Fruit Punch), the powdered Kool Aids (Grape and Tropical Punch), and the Nyquil had an absorbance too high for the spectrophotometer to measure. This absorbance was lowered by performing a 25-fold dilution on the Kool Aid Bursts (Cherry, Grape, and Fruit Punch), the G2 Fruit Punch, the Hawaiian Punch, the powdered Kool Aids (Tropical Punch and Grape), two Powerades (Blackberry and Fruit Punch), and the Nyquil. A 12.5-fold dilution was performed on the remaining Powerades (Lemon Lime and Mountain Berry Blast), and Gatorade Tropical Cooler. Mountain Dew was decarbonated prior to analysis by placing a beaker containing the liquid and a magnetic stir bar on a stir plate and allowing the beverage to be stirred for several minutes.
